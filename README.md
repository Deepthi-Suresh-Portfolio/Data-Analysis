# About

Hi, My name is Deepthi.I am a Master of Analytics candidate and I'm very excited about the field of data analytics and consulting. 

I have over 5.5 years of experience in different areas of the retail and consulting domains. However, during my role as an Inventory Analyst, I discovered my passion for learning more about data analytics and its applications in the industry. As a senior inventory analyst, I analyzed data to determine the optimal allocation of products to each store using data analysis tools such as Blue Yonder JDA and MicroStrategy. Some of the key skills I picked up during this tenure are trend analysis, Demand Forecasting, KPI Monitoring, inventory allocation, and replenishment. I then decided to transition into a functional consultant role where I had the opportunity to assist in the implementation of various retail ERP solutions for clients across the world. I learned critical business skills like stakeholder management, requirement elicitation, and software implementation cycle which further deepened my interest in analytics and strengthened my resolve to specialize in the field. I am now in the process of acquiring a masterâ€™s degree in Analytics. I am currently enhancing my technical skills in Python, R, and SQL through courses in Applied Analytics (R programming), Data pre-processing (R programming), and Database Concepts (SQL) as a part of my masters program.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.
