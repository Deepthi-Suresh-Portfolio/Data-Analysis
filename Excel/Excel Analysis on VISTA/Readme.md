The households in Victoria use different modes of transportation to reach their destination. This information can be used by the Victorian government to make informed transport and land-use planning decisions. This study aims to profile the different households in Melbourne and periodically Geelong and identify their travel behaviour. 

The analysis is based on the VISTA Household dataset published on the Victoria State Government Website. The data consists of information from 30,195 households in Melbourne and Geelong between the years 2012 to 2020.

**Findings:**

* Households that were part of the Survey were majorly from the Melbourne Middle and outer region, with 42% of the members in the age group of 20-39 years.
* There is a significant difference in the travel during the weekday and weekend, with 74.09% of the households travelling during the weekday, compared to a 25.91% during the weekend.
* It was also noticed that majority of the household owned on an average 1-3 vehicles and bicycles. However, the no of vehicles owned doesnâ€™t really depend on the number of members in the household.
* The study also indicated that households with over 2000$ average income tend to purchase Terrace/townhouses or Separate housings.
