The project showcases my data pre-processing knowledge and skills by generating and pre-processing realistic synthetic data relevant to Woolworths.


I have generated two datasets for Woolworths. The first dataset is the Inventory dataset containing information regarding the various product categories and product names that Woolworths carry, along with their supplier’s name and Stock in Hand. The dataset consists of 100 observations and 5 variables as given below:

  * Product_id(NUM) - unique identifier of the products available
  * Category(CHR) - broad categorisation of the product
  * Product_Name(CHR) - individual product names
  * Quantity_stock(NUM) - the stock in hand for each product
  * Supplier(CHR) - the name of the supplier providing the products to Woolworths


The second dataset is a Sales dataset of Woolworths. It consists of 100 observations with 8 variables as given below:
  * Order_No(NUM) - the transaction number for the purchase
  * Sale_Date(DATE) - the date on which the sale happened
  * Sales_Quantity(NUM) - the no of units purchased
  * Price(NUM) - the price of the products after discounts
  * Payment Methods(INT) - the method of payment used by the customers like Cash, card, online or giftcards
  * Discount(NUM) - the discount offered by Woolworths on individual items
  * Product_id(NUM) - id of the items purchased
  * Total_Sales(NUM) - correlated variable calculated using a formula indicating the total sales generated by the store

All the variables are then combined to form the Sales_Dataset and summary statistics like the mean, median, first and third quartiles, and the standard deviation are generated. The data is then scanned for missing values.The missing values in the Discount variable is dealt by imputing NAs with the mean of discount using the ‘impute’function.The missing values in Supplier variable is removed by deleting them using the ‘complete.cases’ function as they account for only <5% of the data and will not impact any of the calculations in this study.
