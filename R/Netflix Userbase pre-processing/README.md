This project involves the pre-processing of Netflix Userbase data. It demonstrates my knowledge of locating open data from the web, importing it into R, reflecting upon the data types, formats, and structures in the data set, and inspecting the data using R functions such as DIM, SUMMARY, UNIQUE, FACTOR, IS.MATRIX, IS.DATAFRAME, CBIND etc.

The project also demonstrates the following outcomes:
  * Utilise leading open-source software, R, to address and resolve data wrangling tasks.
  * Select, perform, and justify data validation processes for raw datasets to satisfy quality requirements.
  * Apply and evaluate the best practice standards of Tidy Data Principles.

The data set provides an insight on Netflix user base with a 1 month plan and the monthly revenue
generated. The data contains information on 2500 users between the age group of 26 and 51.
