It is well known fact that Sydney and Melbourne has varying climatic conditions.This analysis aims to investigates the weather in Sydney and Melbourne using descriptive statistical tools and determining the normality distribution of each variable.
The data is a subset of 93 observation collected over 3 months in 2023 in both Sydney and Melbourne. It contains two variables -

    1. Solar Exposure - The Daily global solar exposure is the total solar energy for a day falling on a horizontal surface. It is the highest during Summers and lowest during Winters.

    2. Maximum temperature - The highest temperature recorded in 24 hours

The approach to the investigation includes calculating Mean, Median, IQR, Quartiles, Standard Deviation etc. to provide a summary of the variables in both Sydney and Melbourne. Secondly, the analysis will also compare the empirical distribution of each variable to the normal distribution in both the cities.

**Findings:**

* The Summary statistics shows that on an average Sydney has slightly higher Solar Exposure with a mean of 16.5, compared to a 15.2 in Melbourne. However a maximum of 31.7 was recorded in Melbourne in the last 3 months.
* Solar Exposure is a Skewed distribution in both the cities, where the mean is greater than median and hence they are both Right Skewed distributions.
* The maximum temperature statistics shows that the average temperature is higher in Sydney than in Melbourne with a mean of 24.79 compared to a 22.42 in Melbourne. Melbourne also has much lower minimum temperatures than Sydney, with the lowest being 11.50.
* The Maximum temperature variable is a Skewed distribution where the temperature in Melbourne is right skewed ( i.e mean is greater than median ) and in Sydney is left Skewed ( i.e mean is lessthan median).
