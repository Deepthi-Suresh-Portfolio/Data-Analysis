Over the years, the Life expectancy continues to increase, which can be attributed to different factors such as health care access, income, GDP etc.

The study is conducted on the Survival to the age of 65 factor across different Countries in the world, based on the Gender. Survival to age 65 refers to the percentage of a cohort of newborn infants that would survive to age 65, if subject to age specific mortality rates of the specified year.

The study also conducts an exploratory analysis on the income group of the countries and the average Survival rate, along with the trend of the rate for males and females over the years.

The study aims to find if there is a statistically significant difference between average % of the cohort surviving till the age of 65 among males and females.

Descriptive statistics are also performed to identify trends between the survival rates for males and females over the years( 1960-2021), as well comparison between the countries income group and the survival rate by plotting relevant visualizations.

**Findings**

* The results of the two-sample t-test assuming unequal variance found a statistically significant difference between the mean survival rates of males and females

* The average survival rate is the highest( 77.59% ) for high income countries and lowest (43.98%) for low income countries.
