This project is a part of the Practical Data Science (with Python) course (COSC2670/COSC2738) at RMIT University.

The project focuses on applying machine learning techniques to a dataset related to the attributes and quality of wine to analyze the relationship between physicochemical tests and wine quality. The dataset consists of 4781 instances with 12 variables, including inputs such as pH levels, alcohol, and density, and an output representing the wine quality, which is rated on a scale of 0 to 10. The tasks involve performing regression, classification, and clustering tasks using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn.

**Tasks Overview**

Task 1: Regression

* Load the dataset and take a random sample of 200 instances (alcohol and density variables).
* Visualize the relationship between alcohol and density.
* Build and evaluate a Simple Linear Regression model, interpreting the coefficients.

Task 2: Classification

* Take a random sample of 500 instances and classify wine quality using the kNN classifier.
* Tune the kNN classifier and evaluate its performance.
* Implement and evaluate a Decision Tree classifier and compare it with the kNN model.

Task 3: Clustering

* Take a random sample of 300 instances and apply clustering algorithms (k-Means and DBSCAN).
* Evaluate the clustering results using appropriate metrics and discuss the limitations and strengths of each algorithm.

Task 4: Report/Presentation
* Write a report summarizing the key results, explanations, and findings from Tasks 1â€“3.
