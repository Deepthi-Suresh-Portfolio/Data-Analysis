This project is part of the Practical Data Science with Python course (COSC2670/COSC2738). 

This assignment focuses on the implementation and evaluation of recommender systems, particularly movie recommendation models, using the MovieLens 1M Dataset. The tasks involve working with both kNN-based Collaborative Filtering and Matrix Factorization-based Recommendation Systems, evaluating their performance, and conducting a ranking-based evaluation.

**Tasks Overview**

Task 1: kNN-based Collaborative Filtering

* Implement and evaluate user-based collaborative filtering using kNN.
* Use RMSE as the evaluation metric and test the impact of various values of k.
* Compare at least two similarity metrics to determine the best one.

Task 2: Matrix Factorization-based Recommendation

* Implement a recommender system using matrix factorization techniques such as SVD, NMF, or ALS.
* Evaluate performance using RMSE and improve it using an appropriate approach.
* Clearly describe the matrix factorization approach and any improvements in your slides and presentation.

Task 3: Ranking-based Evaluation and Comparison

* Compare the performance of the kNN-based collaborative filtering and the improved matrix factorization approach using AP (Average Precision) and NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain).
* Visualize the results using appropriate graphs for each metric.
* Explain why the improved matrix factorization approach performs better than kNN.
