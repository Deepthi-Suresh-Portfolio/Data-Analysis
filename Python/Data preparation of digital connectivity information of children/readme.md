This project is part of the Practical Data Science with Python course (COSC2670/COSC2738). The task involves analyzing a dataset containing information about children in school attendance age and their internet connectivity at home. The dataset is used to perform various steps of the data science process, including data preparation, cleaning, exploration, and analysis. This project includes tasks to explore the dataset by applying statistical methods and visualizations.



**Tasks Overview**

Task 1: Data Preparation

* Load the CSV dataset provided (A1data.csv).
* Identify and address errors/issues in the data.
* Save the cleaned data into a new CSV file named S3991481-cleaned-A1data.csv.

Task 2: Data Exploration

* Subtask 2.1: Create a boxplot to show the overall percentage of children with internet access at home, grouped by region, and compute the median for each region.
* Subtask 2.2: Calculate the mean percentage of children with internet access at home for both the Poorest and Richest wealth quintiles, and display the top 10 countries with the highest percentages in both categories.
* Subtask 2.3: For the Lower Middle Income group, compare the percentages of children with internet access in rural vs urban areas using three statistical measures (mean, median, and standard deviation).
